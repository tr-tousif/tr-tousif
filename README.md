## Hi there

<!--
I am freelance web developer currently learning PHP & JavaScript. I would like to create complex web applications using popular frameworks. Check my repositories for open source projects.

## Hire me for your project

I works on web apps projects from simple blog to complex web applications. If you want to hire me then you must note these points that your project is not about...

- ❌ Adult related content e.g. Pornography, Dating, Gambling, Alcohol, Drugs.
- ❌ Piracy or unauthorized selling.
- ❌ Scamming, Cheat and Fraud.
- ❌ And all kind of illegal activities under the government law.

If these topics are available in your project then you have to look for someone else.
