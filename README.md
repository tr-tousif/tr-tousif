## Hi there

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=tr-tousif)

I am freelance web developer currently learning PHP & JavaScript. I would like to create complex web applications using popular frameworks. Check my repositories for open source projects.

## Hire me for your project

I works on web apps projects from simple blog to complex web applications. If you want to hire me then you must note these points that your project is not about...

‚ùå *Adult related content e.g. Pornography, Dating, Gambling, Alcohol, Drugs.
‚ùå *Piracy or unauthorized selling.
‚ùå *Scamming, Cheat and Fraud.
‚ùå *And all kind of illegal activities under the government law.

If these topics are available in your project then you have to look for someone else.
